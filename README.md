# pravega-demo
This is a chatting room demo.

In the p-demo direcotry, I realized a Console based User Interface chatting room with the following functions based on Pravega 0.9.1 and JRE 13:

- 1 to 1 chatting;
- Group chatting;
- Files transferring;



In the p-spring-demo direcotry, I would try to build a Web User Interface and using the Pravega's REST APIs to realize a chatting room.
